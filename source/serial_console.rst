On Hachiko there is the dedicated serial console connector **CN2**

.. image:: _static/board-cn2.jpg

which you can connect, by means of a mini-USB cable, to your personal computer.

.. note::

 Every operating system has its own killer application to give you a serial terminal interface. In this guide, we are assuming your **host** operating system is **Ubuntu**.

On a Linux (Ubuntu) host machine, the console is seen as a ttyUSBX device and you can access to it by means
of an application like *minicom*.

*Minicom* needs to know the name of the serial device. The simplest way for you to discover
the name of the device is by looking to the kernel messages, so:

1. clean the kernel messages

.. host::

 sudo dmesg -c

2. connect the mini-USB cable to the board

3. display the kernel messages

.. host::

 dmesg

3. read the output

As you can see, here the device has been recognized as **ttyUSB0**.

Now that you know the device name, run *minicom*:

.. host::

 sudo minicom -ws

If minicom is not installed, you can install it with:

.. host::

 sudo apt-get install minicom

then you can setup your port with these parameters:

            | Exit from Minicom        |
            +--------------------------+

If on your system the device has not been recognized as *ttyUSB0*, just replace *ttyUSB0*
with the proper device.

Once you are done configuring the serial port, you are back to *minicom* main menu and you can select *exit*.
