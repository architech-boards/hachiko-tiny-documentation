This amazing board gets the power directly from the USB, so it comes with no external power supply.

This is what the box looks like

The board itself has been programmed to boot to a Linux console of a really tiny distribution,
custom tailored to fit the 10MB of internal ram of Renesas's SoC.

Shall we power on the board for the first time? Of course!

Give *root* to the login prompt:

.. board::

 hachiko login: root

and press *Enter*.

.. note::

 Sometimes, the time you spend setting up minicom makes you miss all the output that leads to the login and you see just a black screen, press *Enter* then to get the login prompt.

Enjoy!
