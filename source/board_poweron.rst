Power-On
========

Hachiko takes the power from the micro-USB connector *CN11* and/or the mini-USB connector *CN2*.

On connector *CN2* you can also have the serial console, so, during your daily development use,
you would just connect your workstation to the board using a mini-USB to connector *CN2*. If you
connect some power ungry device to the board, you can give more power to the board by connecting
your workstation (or a smartphone-like battery charger for example) to the board by means of a
micro-USB cable to board connector *CN11*.
