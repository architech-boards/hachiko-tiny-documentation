If you are a new user of the **Yocto based SDK** we suggest you to read the :ref:`quick` chapter,
otherwise, if you want to have a better understanding of specific topics, just jump directly to
the chapter that interests you the most.

Furthermore, we encourage you to read the `official Yocto Project documentation <https://www.yoctoproject.org/documentation>`_.
