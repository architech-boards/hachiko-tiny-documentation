Give *root* to the login prompt:

.. board::

 hachiko login: root

and press *Enter*.

.. note::

 Sometimes, the time you spend setting up minicom makes you miss all the output that leads to the login and you see just a black screen, press *Enter* then to get the login prompt.

*CN2* is used also to provide the power to the board, so, as soon as your serial terminal emulator is ready you start getting messages from the board.
